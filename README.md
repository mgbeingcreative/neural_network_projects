# neural_network_projects
This is the repo, where I will show a progression for learning the basics of Neutral Networks

Projects to pursue:
- Neural Network regression that is trained for a few basic functions:
  - y = x
  - y = sqrt(x)
  - y = x^2 + z^2
- Neural Network classifier that is trained for a few simulations:
  - Gaussian
  - Multiple Gaussian
- Kaggle Competitions?

For each of these, determine impact of:
- Changes to:
  - number of nodes
  - number of layers
  - cleanliness of dataset: smearing function?
- How it impacts:
  - time to convergence
  - final accuracy
